Practice free APIs for anime quotes using Retrofit

### Problem: ❌
  - I was lacking practical knoweledge with APIs.
  - So, I decided to practice with something lovely/intersting with it.
  - Searched for some public APIs and found AnimeChan about Anime quotes.
  
### Solution: ✔
  - Defined Retrofit dependency.
  - Built Model class for anime quote.
  - Built Retrofit interface that will define **@Get** functions.
  - Built Simple UI to get user interactions to deal with API.
  
### How to use: 🐱‍👤
  - User could search for quotes by either anime name or character name.
  - Also he can get a random quote.
  - **API just provide 10 quotes/fetch and i think it's fixed, the app will display same quotes for each anime/character**
